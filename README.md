# math-expression-parser

This is code written for an old interview
I didn't spent much time on it, that's why it's not the best code you can see.
I put it here becasuse I want to do

- [x] structure refactoring
- [x] add some phpspec tests
- [ ] add some behat tests
- [ ] improve adding support for round brackets
